		Elevating the simple act of counting to a new philosophical dimension.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>MonadCount</strong> is not just another counting app—it's a project that infuses the mundane with a touch of philosophy. Inspired by the concept of <em>monads</em> from the 17th-century philosopher <strong>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</strong>, we aim to transform individual units into a collective understanding of human behavior.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Leibniz's philosophy, monads are the fundamental, indivisible units that make up the universe. Similarly, each count in MonadCount represents an individual—a unique entity contributing to a larger pattern. By capturing these individual units, we can gain insights into crowd behavior and movement within spaces.
	</p>
	<p>
		At its core, MonadCount is about people counting. But it's more than just tallying numbers; it's about recognizing each person as a significant part of a larger whole. With our technology—including ESP32 devices acting as sniffers to collect data—we're able to gather information that contributes to a deeper understanding of how people interact with their environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		This project is open-source and welcomes contributions:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Sibyx/monadcount-sniffer" target="_blank">monadcount-sniffer</a> - ESP32 firmware for data collection</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Sibyx/monadcount-api" target="_blank">monadcount-api</a> - API server and web interface</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>MonadCount</strong> is part of a thesis project at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. The aim is to explore innovative ways of collecting and analyzing data to understand human patterns and behaviors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stay tuned for more updates, including opportunities to participate in the project. For now, feel free to explore our repositories and contribute to the development of MonadCount.
